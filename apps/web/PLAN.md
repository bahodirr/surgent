# PLAN

## Status
- Awaiting product details.

## Open questions (needed to scope + backend decision)
1) What are we building (1 sentence)?
2) Platform (web/mobile/desktop/extension)?
3) Users: single user or multi-user accounts?
4) Data to store + should it sync across devices?
5) Integrations/APIs (payments, email, AI, maps, etc.)?
6) Real-time features or scheduled jobs/notifications?
7) Any security/compliance needs?

## Backend decision
- TBD (insufficient info).

## Next step
- User to answer the open questions; then we’ll finalize MVP + milestones and decide backend: yes/no.
